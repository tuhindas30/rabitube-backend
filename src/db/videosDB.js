First of all, I just love a Pop song that is guitar driven, we don't have enough of those these days! But also, HOW COOL IS IT that this follows the melody to Forever Young?! :D All you will need to play Memories are 5 guitar chords (C, G, D, Bm, and Em; I'll have chord charts in the pinned comment!), a capo on 4th fret, and a couple of picking patterns! Let me know if you have any questions in the comments below :)

    Thanks for checking out my video! If you have any suggestions for a song in this style you would like to learn let me know and if you have any questions hit that comment section below! Thanks for watching! :)

      "The legend of Kishore Kumar is like a golden nostalgia to an average Bengali mind. And if that is tied up with Rabindra Sangeet or Tagore Songs then that's a cherry on the cake. Tagore Songs sung by Kishore Kumar is still a raging hit with the Bengali mass all over the world. Kishore Kumar is the legendary figure when it comes to playback singing in India. But apart from Film songs Kishore Kumar was also a very popular artist who sang various genres including Rabindra Sangeet. This album “Diner Sheshey Ghumer Deshe” is a compilation of Rabindra Sangeet sung by this legendary playback artist, Kishore Kumar. Kishore Kumar in general is considered as one of the most successful & greatest playback singers of the Hindi film industry. But apart from Hindi he sang in many Indian languages including Bengali, Marathi, Assamese, Gujarati etc. He has also sung in private albums in several languages especially Kishore Kumar's Bengali Songs are noted as all time classics. Kishore Kumar started his cinema career as a chorus singer at Bombay Talkies, where his brother worked. Kishore's first film appearance was in Shikari (1946), in which his brother Ashok played the lead role. Music director S. D. Burman is credited with spotting Kishore Kumar's talent for singing. Burman recorded Kishore Kumar's voice for Dev Anand's Munimji (1954), Taxi Driver (1954),  Paying Guest (1957), Guide (1965), Jewel Thief (1967), Prem Pujari (1970), and Tere Mere Sapne (1971). He also composed music for Kishore Kumar's home production Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958). These songs sung in the melodious voice of Kishore Kumar are still super duper hits amongst the masses. This is a true classic and is a must listen. ",

Anyways enjoy your practice. Take your time if your a beginner don’t rush into many things. Slow practice is the key. Happy practice 😀
